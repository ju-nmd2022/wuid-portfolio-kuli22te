          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Linnea Kurman and I'm 22 years old. I'm originally from
            Stockholm, but I moved to Jönköping to study the New media program at
            Jönköpings University. In my spare time I like to watch tv-shows, hang
            with friends, eat and sleep. I also like spending time with my family
            and our Dog Nova. My favourite food is Raclette, but I also like a good
            pasta and bacon, you can never go wrong with Bacon.

        <h2>Before Uni</h2>
        <p>
          Before i Started my studies at Jönköping University I graduated
          secondary school from Tullinge Gymnasium with a economics degree. After
          high school I have been working at multiple places, mostly i have worked
          in customer service but i have also worked at a warehouse, in a School
          Kitchen and as a postman. I had as a goal to be able to backpack for a
          year before studying but unfortunately Covid-19 came and put a stop to
          that plan, but this summer before School started I had the opportunity
          to travel for a month in Europe.</p>

      <!--Section 3 Why NMD-->
    <section>
        <h2>Why NMD</h2>
        <p>
          I chose to study the New media Program because I wanted to study
          something that is both practical and theoretical and gives you the
          opportunity to work in another country. It was also important to me to
          choose a program that included an internship and the possibility of a
          semester abroad. But most of all I chose this program because it seemed
          fun and like something that would fit me well.

      <!--Section 4 Hobbies-->
    <section>
        <h2>My hobbies</h2>
        <p>
          In my spare time I like to spend time with friends and just chill or do
          some activities. I also like to watch Tv shows, which sadly enough I
          have spent a lot of time on and I have watched many good and a lot of
          bad tv series. I also like to ride and be in the stable which I don´t do
          a lot anymore, but previously I have competed in both dressage and
          showjumping and had my own horse for a while. I also have an interest in
          Formula 1 and try to watch it on time every weekend it's aired. Travel
          is also a intresset of mine and is something I want to do more in the
          future.
